/\DAY 1/\
a. first lesson on routes: hold the links to the various views(webpages)

/\DAY 2/\
I learnt about making general layouts that can be used as a template by the blade templating engine.
$slot variable is used as a blade helper to display info in h1-h6, 
also I learnt that <?php echo $slot ?>  is just the same as {{ $slot }}. This means that the double curly braces are to echo info on the webpage.
next up: Tailwind CSS for the layout practice.
