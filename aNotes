/\DAY 1/\
a. first lesson on routes: hold the links to the various views(webpages)

/\DAY 2/\
I learnt about making general layouts that can be used as a template by the blade templating engine.
$slot variable is used as a blade helper to display info in h1-h6, 
also I learnt that <?php echo $slot ?>  is just the same as {{ $slot }}. This means that the double curly braces are to echo info on the webpage.
next up: Tailwind CSS for the layout practice.

/\DAY 3/\
I built a 3-page layout.


ASSIGNMENT: create a dynamic nav-bar-link layout,
that uses one template with the {{$slot}} to display which page is active.

/\DAY 4/\
Intro to components in laravel. ($attributes). Used for templates that have attributes like in HTML (i.e. href="", id="" or even class="")
Intro to tailwind css UI.

/\DAY 5/\
How to edit sections in the template to suite the route(on both desktop and mobile).
Leanrned how to create custom {{slot}} for the template. 
The request helper function [request()->]. It is an object called to grab the info from the current request by it's attribute methods
<!-- this line is static. i.e. it can only move to the home page..
 making it dynamic we introduce the attributes of each line by our slot variable -->
<a {{ $attributes }}>{{ $slot }}</a>
Ctrl + Alt + Up to type on multiple lines
in laravel there are props and attributes:
an attribute is href, id, class etc. the prop is anything that is not an attribute
--Assignment
introduce a new prop called type which will indicate whetget the navlink should be presented as a anchor tag  or a button
